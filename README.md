2. **Education:** PhD recipient lists, useful information for new PIs and those working on a sounding rocket
3. **Publications:** Science publications resulting from data collected on sounding rockets, program office reports, and any other related publications
4. **Launches:** A list of past science, educational, and technology flights

## Contributing
There are two ways to contribute to this site:
1. **Update the site content:**  For small changes (e.g., addition of a new PhD recipient, or adding publications), just open a new issue.  This is the easiest way as then the site maintainers will do the work of adding the content to the appropriate place on the site.
2. **Update the site structure/features:**  If you want to make more elaborate changes, then use the standard GitHub procedure of forking the repos and working on a personal gh-pages branch (which can be tested).  Changes can be incorporated into the main branch by requesting a pull request.
