	<b>Purpose</b>
	<p>To counsel the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
    on the performance and plans of the NASA Sounding Rocket Program,
    with particular emphasis on the operation and support of sounding
    rocket payloads.</p>
    <p>To provide a forum for exchange of information on sounding rocket
    systems, operational support, and developments in science as they
    affect the Sounding Rocket Program.</p>
    <b>Membership</b>
    <p>The Working Group will consist of approximately twelve members, one
    of whom will be the NASA Sounding Rocket Project Scientist, who
    will serve as Chairman.&nbsp; The other members will be appointed
    from the principal scientific disciplines served by sounding rockets
	and from the technical and management support areas of importance
    to the NASA Sounding Rocket Program.&nbsp; Members will be appointed
    by the Director, Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
    <b>Terms of Service</b>
    <p>Except for the Project Scientist, terms of service of the members shall
    normally be three years.</p>
    <b>Implementation</b>
    <p>Meetings will be held as needed but not less than twice yearly.  The
    Chairman shall invite any participants necessary to accomplish
    the business of the meetings.  The agenda for the meetings
    will normally be established by the chairman at least six weeks
	prior to each meeting.  The NSRWG advice will be reported
    to the Sounding Rocket Project Manager at Goddard Space Flight
    Center/Wallops Flight Facility (GSFC/WFF) in addition to the Chairman's
    normal reporting to the GSFC Center Director.  The minutes
    of the meetings will be distributed to both the Sounding Rocket
    Project Manager at GSFC/WFF and to the Sounding Rocket Program
    Manager at NASA Headquarters.</p>
    <b>Project Scientist Role</b>
    <p>The Project Scientist is from the
    Space and Earth Sciences Directorate, GSFC, and serves as Chairman
    of the Sounding Rocket Working Group (SRWG).  On a daily
    basis, the Project Scientist represents the interests of the sounding
    rocket investigators in working with the Project. The Project
    Scientist also evaluates all scientific and engineering requirements
    placed on the Sounding Rocket Program and provides guidance to
    the NASA Headquarters Program Manager, the Sounding Rocket Project
    Manager at GSFC/WFF, and all others involved in the Program.
    The Project Scientist reports to the Center Director, GSFC.</p>
