<h2>The Sounding Rocket Working Group Charter</h2>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
	<b>Purpose</b>
	<p>To counsel the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
    on the performance and plans of the NASA Sounding Rocket Program, 
    with particular emphasis on the operation and support of sounding 
    rocket payloads.</p>
    <p>To provide a forum for exchange of information on sounding rocket 
    systems, operational support, and developments in science as they 
    affect the Sounding Rocket Program.</p>
    <b>Membership</b>
    <p>The Working Group will consist of approximately twelve members, one 
    of whom will be the NASA Sounding Rocket Project Scientist, who 
    will serve as Chairman.&nbsp; The other members will be appointed 
    from the principal scientific disciplines served by sounding rockets 
	and from the technical and management support areas of importance 
    to the NASA Sounding Rocket Program.&nbsp; Members will be appointed 
    by the Director, Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
    <b>Terms of Service</b> 
    <p>Except for the Project Scientist, terms of service of the members shall 
    normally be three years.</p>
    <b>Implementation</b> 
    <p>Meetings will be held as needed but not less than twice yearly.  The 
    Chairman shall invite any participants necessary to accomplish 
    the business of the meetings.  The agenda for the meetings 
    will normally be established by the chairman at least six weeks 
	prior to each meeting.  The NSRWG advice will be reported 
    to the Sounding Rocket Project Manager at Goddard Space Flight 
    Center/Wallops Flight Facility (GSFC/WFF) in addition to the Chairman's 
    normal reporting to the GSFC Center Director.  The minutes 
    of the meetings will be distributed to both the Sounding Rocket 
    Project Manager at GSFC/WFF and to the Sounding Rocket Program 
    Manager at NASA Headquarters.</p>
    <b>Project Scientist Role</b> 
    <p>The Project Scientist is from the 
    Space and Earth Sciences Directorate, GSFC, and serves as Chairman 
    of the Sounding Rocket Working Group (SRWG).  On a daily 
    basis, the Project Scientist represents the interests of the sounding 
    rocket investigators in working with the Project. The Project 
    Scientist also evaluates all scientific and engineering requirements 
    placed on the Sounding Rocket Program and provides guidance to 
    the NASA Headquarters Program Manager, the Sounding Rocket Project 
    Manager at GSFC/WFF, and all others involved in the Program. 
    The Project Scientist reports to the Center Director, GSFC.</p>
