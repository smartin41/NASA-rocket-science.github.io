<font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Unique
              Opportunities for Scientific Research</b>. Many Sounding rockets carry 
              scientific instruments into space along parabolic trajectories,
              providing nearly vertical traversals along their upleg and downleg,
              while appearing to "hover" near their apogee location. Whereas the
              overall time in space is brief (typically 5-20 minutes), for a well-placed
              scientific experiment launched into a geophysical phenomena of interest,
              the short time and low vehicle speeds are more than adequate (in
              some cases they are ideal) to carry out a successful scientific
              experiment. Furthermore, there are some important regions of space
              that are too low to be sampled by satellites (i.e., the lower ionosphere/thermosphere
              and mesosphere below 120 km altitude) and thus sounding rockets
              provide the only platforms that can carry out direct <i>in-situ</i>
              measurements in these regions. Astronomy, solar, and planetary science
              missions include sophisticated telescopes with optional joy-stick
              operated, sub-arc-second pointing for &gt;5 minute continuous observations
              of astronomical objects, including those too close to the sun for
              Hubble or EUVE observations. Microgravity missions are carried out
              on high altitude, free-fall parabolic trajectories which provide
              ideal microgravity environments without the vibrations frequently
              encountered on human-tendered platforms. </font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Low-cost
                Access to Space.</b> Because the science payload does not go into
                orbit, sounding rocket missions do not need expensive boosters
                or extended telemetry and tracking coverage. As a result, mission
                costs are substantially less than those required for orbiter missions.
                Furthermore, because the program is managed and the payloads are
                built in one central location (e.g., the NASA/Wallops Flight Facility),
                significant savings are realized through efficient, cost-savings
                operations that procures parts and rocket motors in large quantities
                and utilizes past designs of sub-systems for follow-on missions.
                In other words, the sounding rocket program takes advantage of
                a high degree of commonality and heritage of rockets, payloads,
                and sub-systems flown repeatedly.&nbsp; In many cases, only the
                experiment -- provided by the scientist -- is changed. Costs are
                also very low because of the acceptance of a higher degree of
                risk in the mission (compared to orbital missions), although safety
                is never compromised.&nbsp; In some cases (such as almost all
                astronomy, planetary, solar, and microgravity missions), the payloads
                are recovered which means the costs of the experiment and sub-systems
                are spread out over many missions.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Rapid,
                quick-turn-around.</b> Not only are sounding rocket missions carried
                out at very low cost, but also the payload can be developed in
                a very short time frame -- sometimes as quickly as 3 months! This
                rapid response enables scientists to react quickly to new phenomena
                (such as observing the Shoemaker-Levy comet impact to Jupiter)
                and to incorporate the latest, most up-to-date technology in their
                experiments.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Validating
                New Instruments and Developing New Technology.</b> The sounding
                rocket program continues to serve as a low-cost testbed for new
                scientific techniques, scientific instrumentation, and spacecraft
                technology, eventually flown on numerous satellite missions. For
                example, COBE, CGRO, EVUE, FAST, ASTRO-2, UARS, SOHO, TRACE, and
                numerous other recent NASA Satellite missions have been enabled
                by technology and techniques developed in the suborbital program.
                Furthermore, the low cost of sounding rocket access to space fosters
                innovation: instruments and/or technologies which are not sufficiently
                developed to warrant the investment of satellite-program scale
                funding are often "proto-typed" with initial space testing on
                sounding rockets.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Education.</b>
                In addition to science and technology, sounding rockets also provide
                invaluable tools for education and training. For example, a three-year
                sounding rocket mission at a university provides an excellent
                research opportunity for a Ph.D. dissertation, in which the student
                carries the project through all of its stages&nbsp; --&nbsp; from
                conception to hardware design to flight to data analysis and,
                finally to the publication of the results.&nbsp; This "hands on"
                approach provides the student with invaluable experience of understanding
                the space flight mission as a whole. Indeed, over 350 Ph.D.'s
                have been awarded as part of NASA's sounding rocket program.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Summary.</b>

                critical scientific, technical, and educational contributions
