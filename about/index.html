           <h4>Key Capabilities of Sounding Rockets</h4>

           <p class="card-text">Sounding rockets carry scientific instruments into space along parabolic trajectories, providing nearly vertical traversals along their upleg and downleg, while appearing to "hover" near their apogee location. Whereas the overall time in space is brief (typically 5-20 minutes), for a well-placed scientific experiment happily launched into a geophysical phenomena of interest, the short time and low vehicle speeds are more than adequate (in some cases they are ideal) to carry out a successful scientific experiment. Furthermore, there are some important regions of space that are too low to be sampled by satellites (i.e., the lower ionosphere/thermosphere and mesosphere below 120 km altitude) and thus sounding rockets provide the only platforms that can carry out direct <i>in-situ</i> measurements in these regions. Astronomy, solar, and planetary science missions include sophisticated telescopes with optional joy-stick operated, sub-arc-second pointing for &gt;5 minute continuous observations of astronomical objects, including those too close to the sun for Hubble or EUVE observations. Microgravity missions are carried out on high altitude, free-fall parabolic trajectories which provide ideal microgravity environments without the vibrations frequently encountered on human-tendered platforms.</p>
           <h4 class="card-title">Low-cost Access to Space.</h4>
           <p class="card-text">Because the science payload does not go into orbit, sounding rocket missions do not need expensive boosters or extended telemetry and tracking coverage. As a result, mission costs are substantially less than those required for orbiter missions.  Furthermore, because the program is managed and the payloads are built in one central location (e.g., the NASA/Wallops Flight Facility), significant savings are realized through efficient, cost-savings operations that procures parts and rocket motors in large quantities and utilizes past designs of sub-systems for follow-on missions.  In other words, the sounding rocket program takes advantage of a high degree of commonality and heritage of rockets, payloads, and sub-systems flown repeatedly.&nbsp; In many cases, only the experiment -- provided by the scientist -- is changed. Costs are also very low because of the acceptance of a higher degree of risk in the mission (compared to orbital missions), although safety is never compromised.&nbsp; In some cases (such as almost all astronomy, planetary, solar, and microgravity missions), the payloads are recovered which means the costs of the experiment and sub-systems are spread out over many missions.</p>
