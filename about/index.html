    <h4>Key Capabilities of Sounding Rockets</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
  <br>
  <h5>Unique Opportunities for Scientific Research</h5>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Sounding rockets carry scientific instruments into space along parabolic trajectories, providing nearly vertical traversals along their upleg and downleg, while appearing to "hover" near their apogee location. Whereas the overall time in space is brief (typically 5-20 minutes), for a well-placed scientific experiment happily launched into a geophysical phenomena of interest, the short time and low vehicle speeds are more than adequate (in some cases they are ideal) to carry out a successful scientific experiment. Furthermore, there are some important regions of space that are too low to be sampled by satellites (i.e., the lower ionosphere/thermosphere and mesosphere below 120 km altitude) and thus sounding rockets provide the only platforms that can carry out direct <i>in-situ</i> measurements in these regions. Astronomy, solar, and planetary science missions include sophisticated telescopes with optional joy-stick operated, sub-arc-second pointing for &gt;5 minute continuous observations of astronomical objects, including those too close to the sun for Hubble or EUVE observations. Microgravity missions are carried out on high altitude, free-fall parabolic trajectories which provide ideal microgravity environments without the vibrations frequently encountered on human-tendered platforms.</p>
  <h5>Low-cost Access to Space.</h5>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Because the science payload does not go into orbit, sounding rocket missions do not need expensive boosters or extended telemetry and tracking coverage. As a result, mission costs are substantially less than those required for orbiter missions.  Furthermore, because the program is managed and the payloads are built in one central location (e.g., the NASA/Wallops Flight Facility), significant savings are realized through efficient, cost-savings operations that procures parts and rocket motors in large quantities and utilizes past designs of sub-systems for follow-on missions.  In other words, the sounding rocket program takes advantage of a high degree of commonality and heritage of rockets, payloads, and sub-systems flown repeatedly.&nbsp; In many cases, only the experiment -- provided by the scientist -- is changed. Costs are also very low because of the acceptance of a higher degree of risk in the mission (compared to orbital missions), although safety is never compromised.&nbsp; In some cases (such as almost all astronomy, planetary, solar, and microgravity missions), the payloads are recovered which means the costs of the experiment and sub-systems are spread out over many missions.</p>
  <h5>Rapid, quick-turn-around</h5>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Not only are sounding rocket missions carried
  out at very low cost, but also the payload can be developed in
  a very short time frame -- sometimes as quickly as 3 months! This
  rapid response enables scientists to react quickly to new phenomena
  (such as observing the Shoemaker-Levy comet impact to Jupiter)
  and to incorporate the latest, most up-to-date technology in their
  experiments.</p>
  <h5>Validating New Instruments and Developing New Technology</h5>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The sounding
  rocket program continues to serve as a low-cost testbed for new
  scientific techniques, scientific instrumentation, and spacecraft
  technology, eventually flown on numerous satellite missions. For
  example, COBE, CGRO, EVUE, FAST, ASTRO-2, UARS, SOHO, TRACE, and
  numerous other recent NASA Satellite missions have been enabled
  by technology and techniques developed in the suborbital program.
  Furthermore, the low cost of sounding rocket access to space fosters
  innovation: instruments and/or technologies which are not sufficiently
  developed to warrant the investment of satellite-program scale
  funding are often "proto-typed" with initial space testing on
  sounding rockets.</p>
  <h5>Education</h5>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">In addition to science and technology, sounding rockets also provide
  invaluable tools for education and training. For example, a three-year
  sounding rocket mission at a university provides an excellent
  research opportunity for a Ph.D. dissertation, in which the student
  carries the project through all of its stages&nbsp; --&nbsp; from
  conception to hardware design to flight to data analysis and,
  finally to the publication of the results.&nbsp; This "hands on"
  approach provides the student with invaluable experience of understanding
  the space flight mission as a whole. Indeed, over 400 Ph.D.'s
  have been awarded as part of NASA's sounding rocket program.</p>
